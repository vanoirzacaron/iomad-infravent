* \mod_peerreview\event\phase_automatically_switched event is triggered when the phase is automatically switched within
  the cron task.
* A new method \peerreviewallocation_scheduled::phase_automatically_switched added to handle the
  \mod_peerreview\event\phase_automatically_switched event.
* A new boolean parameter, $checksubmissionphase, has been added to the peerreview_scheduled_allocator::execute() method
  in order to allow (or not) the allocation of submissions to be done in phases other than the SUBMISSION_PHASE.

=== 3.8 ===

* The following functions have been finally deprecated and can not be used anymore:
    * peerreview_scale_used()
